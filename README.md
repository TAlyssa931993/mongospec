## Features

- **Asynchronous Operations**: MongoSpec leverages async programming to handle multiple database requests without blocking.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed, MongoSpec minimizes latency and maximizes throughput.
- **Automatic Collection Binding**: Automatically binds your Python classes to MongoDB collections, simplifying data handling.
- **Msgspec Serialization**: Utilizes msgspec for efficient serialization and deserialization of data.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with popular libraries like Motor and PyMongo.

## Installation

To get started with MongoSpec, you need to install it using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install mongospec
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use MongoSpec in your Python application.

### Basic Example

```python
import asyncio
from mongospec import MongoSpec

async def main():
    # Create a MongoSpec instance
    db = MongoSpec('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase')

    # Define a model
    class User:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

    # Insert a new user
    await db.users.insert_one(User("Alice", 30))

    # Fetch users
    users = await db.users.find()
    for user in users:
        print(user)

# Run the async main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Configuration

You can customize MongoSpec by passing configuration options during initialization. Here‚Äôs how:

```python
db = MongoSpec('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', options={"maxPoolSize": 50})
```

### Error Handling

MongoSpec provides built-in error handling for database operations. You can catch exceptions as follows:

```python
try:
    await db.users.insert_one(User("Bob", 25))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
